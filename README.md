## ðŸ“Œ About this Dashboard
I explored a healthcare dataset and created a three-page interactive Power BI dashboard that dives into patient demographics, common diagnoses, admission types, treatment costs, insurance coverage, and hospital performance. This dashboard aims to simplify complex healthcare insights while delivering an intuitive user experience through interactive drill-downs and cross-filtering visualsâœ¨
I chose a single-color theme with varying shades to maintain a light, pleasant, and soothing look throughout the report.ðŸŽ¨
One of the most exciting aspects was experimenting with field parameters for the first timeâ€”it added powerful dynamic filtering capabilities!
